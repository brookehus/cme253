The following directory contains four scripts, five input files, one pdf report, and two pdf profiler images.

Input files:

arg1      : Example protein file (PDB)
arg2      :    3-pose ligand file
arg2_10   :   10-pose ligand file
arg2_100  :  100-pose ligand file
arg2_1k   : 1000-pose ligand file

Scripts:

kernel.cu : CUDA implementation 1
smem.cu   : CUDA implementation 2 (SMEM)
red.cu    : CUDA implementation 3a (reduction with SMEM, 16x16x4 threads)
red18.cu  : CUDA implementation 3b (reduction with SMEM, 18x18x3 threads)

All scripts contain a baseline cpp implementation.

To compile, run (e.g.):

$ nvcc -std=c++11  kernel.cu -o kernel

Note that debug.h must be in the current directory. It has been provided.

An example command uses arg1 and any of the arg2 files, e.g.,

$ ./kernel arg1 arg2

This will produce an output that looks like this:

Lines in protein file : 4573
Lines in ligand file : 51
Ligand poses in file : 3
Number of distances to compute : 233223
Cpp distances calculated in 113899 microseconds
Using GPU 0: GRID K520
Ready to launch kernel
CUDA distances calculated in: 1915 microseconds

It will also output a distances.txt file with two columns where the first column has the cpp distancs and the second column has the CUDA distances.

All scripts perform the same cpp implementation, but the CUDA implementation depends on the script.
